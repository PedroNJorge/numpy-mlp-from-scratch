# Loss Functions
*An explanation of the loss funtions implemented in the project.*<br>
Each explanation provides the **definition**, **derivative** and **code**.<br>
It is recommended to first read 'Backpropagation in Neural Networks', since it provides deep insights
on the reason behind the need to use these type of functions and the calculation of $\dfrac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial a^{(k)}}$
## **Regression**

### **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
The MSE loss function can be defined as the following:
$$
\begin{aligned}
Without Batches &= W^{(k)}a^{(k-1)} + b^{(k)} \\
With Batch &= \sigma(z^{(k)}) \\
Vectorized &= 
\end{aligned}
$$
